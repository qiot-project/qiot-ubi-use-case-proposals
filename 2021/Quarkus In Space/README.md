# Use case

## Background

A new era of space exploration is beginning, and recently the ESA (European Space Agency) opened two job vacancies to find the next team of astronauts. More vacancies will open up in the coming years.
I believe that our future work is a borderline case on Earth and in space with all the latency, the vast distances, and the dangerous environment.
